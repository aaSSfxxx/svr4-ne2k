# NE2000 driver for UNIX System V Release 4.0

This is an attempt to develop a driver for the NE2000-like ISA cards, which
are not supported "out-of-the-box" by old SVR4. I started this project in
order to get in touch with driver development, and because it's fun to try
to make old dinosaur UNIXes great again !

The driver is currently not functional (it only detects and prints network
card's MAC address at the moment). Developed on SVR Release 4.0 Version 3.0.
